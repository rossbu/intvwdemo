NAT Gateway is a device that provides communication between two sub networks. 
In AWS, NAT gateway service provides communication between different subnets within a VPC.
By enabling NAT gateway we can provide internet access to components inside private subnets without directly making them publicly available.
Nat should be placed in Public subset ( DMZ Zone )
