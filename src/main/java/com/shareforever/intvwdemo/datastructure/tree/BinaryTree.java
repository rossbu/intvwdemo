    Binary Tree:
        A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree


    Binary Search Tree ( BST )
        The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
        The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
        The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
        There must be no duplicate nodes.
